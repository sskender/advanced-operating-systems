# Advanced Operating Systems

Advanced Operating Systems FER labs

## Course Description

Operating systems are vital parts of every computer system and their security is very important. An operating system is a set of programs that act as an intermediary between a user of a computer, the computer hardware and the applications programs. The objective of this course is to study theories, principles and techniques of communication and synchronization mechanisms in distributed systems, device management, computer security, system availability and reliability.

## Learning Outcomes

- apply intraprocessor communication mechanisms and communication mechanisms in distributed systems
- modify mutual exclusion protocols in real distributed systems
- explain and illustrate authentication protocols
- describe device management procedures
- calculate mean time to data loss
- design computer system with redundant array of independent disks (RAID)
